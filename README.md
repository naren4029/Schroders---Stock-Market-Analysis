# Schroders - Stock Market Analysis App

> $ Project Description :

In order to facilitate discretionary management fund managers are often interested in not only looking at prices of stocks today but what they have been previously to gain further insight into companies.

   User Story

   As a fund manager, I want a single page application where I can select stocks on the US Stock Exchange and a date range (from and to date)
   So that I can chart a time series of prices for the selected stocks and date range.
   
   Acceptance Criteria
   
   •	I can display the time series of prices of the selected stocks in the same chart
   
   •	I can’t select more than 3 stocks to display at the same time
   
   •	I can toggle between the following price types in the interactive chart (see Question 5 below)
   
   o	Open Prices
   
   o	High Prices
   
   o	Low Prices
   
   o	Close Prices
   
   •	I can change the date range in the interactive chart
